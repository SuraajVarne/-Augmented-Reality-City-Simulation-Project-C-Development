This code is to read the config and the region files.
The config file contains the info of the file name, time limit and the refresh rate.
The region files contains the information of each zone.
The code checks if the files can be opened and then fetches the data from the config file and then from the region file and stores the map configuration in vectors.
While compiling the program both the "config1.txt" and the "region1.csv" along with the .cpp file needs to be stored in the same folder.
