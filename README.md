- SimCity contains the final product files of this project
- All .h and .cpp files in this directory contribute to the final product, compiled using g++ -o SimCity.exe *.cpp
- Before running the SimCity.exe, each config (.txt) file and region (.csv) file must be under the same directory as the .exe
- Simply run the .exe, and type the config file name as prompted. During the simulation, the user will be prompted for action when required. The simulation will end when the user enters 'q' once prompted
